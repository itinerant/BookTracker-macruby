BookTracker is a simple application for tracking the books you read.  All data is personalized - there is nothing pre-set.

To add a book, enter data in each of the fields in the Add Book section (category is optional as is one of audiobook or pages).  Then click Add Book.

The Date field is set to the current month and last month, assuming that the tracking system is being kept up to date.

--------------------------

The application is built using XCode and MacRuby.  The only gem requirement is 'sqlite3'.
